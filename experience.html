              href="https://developer.metamask.io" target="_blank">MetaMask Developer Platform</a>)</p>
          <p style="text-decoration: underline;">Jan 2022 - Sept 2025</p>
          <p>In my role as Technical Program Manager, I led efforts to build the MetaMask Developer Platform, unifying
            four siloed products (MetaMask Snaps, the API/SDK suite, Infura, and the embedded wallet) into a single
            dashboard used by thousands of businesses. I coordinated across web, engineering, and product organizations
            to align fragmented roadmaps, reduce onboarding friction, and establish a unified go-to-market presence for
            developer tools.</p>

          <p></p>I also led a small team exploring proactive fraud prevention using the Delegation Toolkit. We developed
          an active monitoring system that automatically revoked malicious token approvals, and an LLM-driven
          transaction risk scoring engine, shifting the approach from reactive warnings to intelligent user protection.
          </p>

          In my initial Developer Relations role, I laid the groundwork through developer content creation, hackathon
          coordination, and documentation architecture that supported thousands of developers integrating with Consensys
          products.</p>

          <p style="text-decoration: underline;">Jan 2020 - Nov 2021</p> 
          <p> I co-founded Engine Systems during COVID, at a time when companies were scrambling to adapt to remote
            work. Having worked remotely as engineers for years, my co-founder and I saw an opportunity to help
            businesses build the tools they needed. We grew from a two-person team to seven engineers and a product
            designer in under two years, and I led the product development effort across clients in the US and Nigeria.
          </p>
          <p>Our work spanned fintech and workforce management. For <a class="colored"
              href="https://stir.vercel.app" target="_blank">Stir Money</a>, I oversaw the development of a
            dashboard that solved fragmented income visibility for creators by unifying earnings across platforms
            through
            integrations with 20+ fintech APIs. For <a class="colored" href="https://gigster.com" target="_blank">Gigster</a>, I led the build of a talent matching portal with integrated
            project management features that streamlined their hiring and delivery process. We also built tools for
            several local businesses in Nigeria.
          </p>
          <p>
            I ultimately left to explore crypto's potential to expand access to global financial systems in emerging
            economies
            .</p>

          <p style="font-style: italic;"> Snr Software Engineer</p>
          <p style="text-decoration: underline;">March 2018 - Dec 2019</p>
          <p> I worked as a Senior Software Engineer at Generation Enterprise, an NGO that built tools supporting Lagos
            State Government's efforts to help at-risk youth launch small businesses through training, local hubs, and
            incubation programs.
          </p>
          <p>I worked across two platforms. I redesigned a government youth portal serving millions of young people,
            improving performance and accessibility. I also migrated their CRM platform from a monolithic architecture
            to microservices on AWS, reducing infrastructure costs significantly.</p>
